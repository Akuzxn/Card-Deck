Card deck code


Project description
The goal with this card deck code is to be able to conveniently use and 
store cards in a deck that gives an overall on every existing card. 
The main purpose of creating this code is in other words, not decided 
by me but rather the people that use this code when it comes to for 
example black jack, or other card games. During the creation of this code, 
there wasn't any problems in particular that i had problem with but more 
of just teaching myself underway as i went on. This project needed a lot 
of help from external sources.



How to run the program
In the program, all you do is quite literally press the run button. When 
this button is pressed, the cards stored in the deck will be printed.


Included in this project, i had some help from teachers and friends including Angel, Mathias, Bashir. Though they didnt do that much they
were useful when it came to giving tips on how to better my code.
